# Deep_Learning_Baiscs
This is a repo that I will be using to teach myself the basics of Deep Learning Applications in various domains. Please keep in mind that at the time of the repo creation, I already have a 4+ years of professional working experience in Medical Computer Vision domain and my process here may not be suitable for a total beginner.

Deep learning has found applications in various domains, each forming a specialized area of study. Here are some key areas where deep learning techniques are widely applied:
