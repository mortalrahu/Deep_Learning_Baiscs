# Directory for exploring the Mobility data and its ML Applications 

This is a directory where we explore all different types of the Mobility data and apply them to ml models to learn insights from the data.

1. **GPS Data**:


   *Data*
   - Location coordinates (latitude, longitude)
   - Speed and direction of travel
   - Timestamped location data
   
   *ML Models*
   - Clustering Models: DBSCAN, K-means (for identifying common routes and hotspots)
   - Time Series Models: ARIMA, LSTM (for predicting future locations or travel times)
   - Classification Models: Random Forest, SVM (for classifying types of trips, e.g., work commute vs. leisure)


2. **Sensor Data**:


   *Data*
   - Accelerometer data (acceleration in x, y, z axes)
   - Gyroscope data (orientation and angular velocity)
   - Magnetometer data (magnetic field strength)
   
   *ML Models*
   - Anomaly Detection Models: Autoencoders, Isolation Forest (for detecting abnormal driving behavior or incidents)
   - Activity Recognition Models: CNN, RNN (for recognizing driving patterns or detecting accidents)

   
3. **User Behaviour Data**:


   *Data*
   - User Preferences and Interaction Data
   - Travel patterns and routines
   - Trip start and end points
   - Frequent destinations
   
   *ML Models*
   - Recommender Systems: Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization (for personalized travel recommendations)
   - Behavioral Prediction Models: Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting (for predicting user preferences and future behavior)



4. **Environmental Data**:


   *Data*
   - Traffic conditions
   - Weather data
   - Road Conditions
   
   *ML Models*
   - Regression Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression (for predicting travel time based on traffic and weather conditions)
   - Geospatial Models: Geostatistical models, Spatial-temporal models (for mapping and predicting traffic patterns)

5. **Contextual Data**:


   *Data*
   - Event-based data (e.g., road incidents, construction)
   - Public transportation schedules

   
   *ML Models*
   - Event Prediction Models: Bayesian Networks, Hidden Markov Models (for predicting the impact of events on travel)
   - Multi-modal Models: Ensemble models combining various data sources (for comprehensive travel insights)

6. **Demographic Data**:

   *Data*
   - Age, gender, and other demographic information 
   - Socioeconomic data

   
   *ML Models*
   - Segmentation Models: K-means, Hierarchical Clustering (for segmenting users into different demographic groups)
   - Profiling Models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes (for profiling and predicting user behaviors based on demographics)

7. **Text and Log Data**:


   *Data*
   - User feedback and reviews 
   - Logs from mobile apps and services

   
   *ML Models*
   - Natural Language Processing (NLP) Models: BERT, LSTM (for analyzing user feedback and extracting insights)
   - Sentiment Analysis Models: VADER, TextBlob (for gauging user sentiment from reviews and feedback)
